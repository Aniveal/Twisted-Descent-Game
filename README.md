# Twisted Descent
A small rogue-like game with physics based combat. Made for ETH Game Lab 2022.

## Overview
You are playing as Theseus exploring the labyrinth of the minotaur. 
Armed with nothing but the thread of ariadne you have to defeat hordes of enemies by flinging them into walls, holes or explosive amphoras. 
The deeper you go into the procedurally generated labyrinth levels the more dangerous it gets. How far can you go?

## Features
### Physics
Like in real life, this game has physics. Unlike real life, your thread is indestructible and can throw a 200kg minotaur!
### Procedurally generated Levels
Each level is randomly generated once you enter. The deeper you go the bigger and confusing they get. Smartly use your thread to mark the paths you already explored or find back to the entrance.

## Installation
In assignments/releases you can find different stages of the development process. We highly suggest you play the final_release version.
The game runs only on a Windows machine.
You can also install MonoGame and build the game yourself.
